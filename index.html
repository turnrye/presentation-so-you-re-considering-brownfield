              Last winter we released our first greenfield React Native application. We faced some classic newcomer issues, but overall it went pretty smoothly. We were impressed with what performance could be both from the application and the developers. We had a bigger application that was native, and the product team had a long backlog for it. I was faced with the question: how?

              Brownfield can also be a way to migrate an existing app from some other platform to React Native. It's a path to transform a codebase into a React Native application.

              The obvious thing though is that brownfield isn't initialized via the CLI or Expo. It doesn't come from templates.

            <aside class="notes">
              At it's heart, brownfield lets you develop React Native on something that wasn't originally React Native. And depending on how far you go, it might be a path to moving a codebase to end up like a greenfield app.

              We have an Android+iOS native app in the appstore that was
              <strong>hurting</strong>
            </p>
            <p>We needed to overhaul it</p>
            <aside class="notes">
                So I mentioned earlier that our product folks were ready for a refresh. We had an app with millions of users that was largely written in 2014. Both the objective-c and android codebases had architectural issues, and they were becoming a burden to maintain.
              </aside>
          </section>
          <section>
            <p>
              Even with the most aggressive timeline, we needed to add new
              features and maintain the old app before the new is ready
            </p>
            <aside class="notes">
              Our product owner continued to challenge us to implement new features, but we'd gotten to the point where everyone understood significant infrastructure work needed to be done. But the demand for improvements couldn't completely stop, as our had a business with over 6,000 stores to support. We couldn't delay regulatory or compliance changes to support a greenfield development.
            </aside>
          </section>
          <section>
            <p>We have just 1 team</p>
            <aside class="notes">
              And to complicate things even more, our group was small enough that we couldn't support splitting up into "legacy" and "nextgen" teams. We had to improve the infrastructure, refresh the user experience, and handle urgent business demands all at the same time.

              We did have one trick though; we'd developed a greenfield react native app in the past.

            </p>
            <aside class="notes">And we knew many other teams were using React for web development. We knew that if we converged on React, our small team would benefit from the larger organization.

              <li>Business alignment</li>
            </ul>
            <aside class="notes">First, a couple of filter questions. Is your team setup to develop cross platform? This was important, because you need the team to support native, react native, continuous integration, or even quality engineering technology. You can't approach this with a team identifying themselves as an "Android" or an "iOS" team. Also, are you ready to support the language that you'll be forced to write in? Some organizations have policies dictating what languages may be used. Finally, is your business team aligned with investing effort in this transformation? Remember that this isn't a purely technical decision: adopting a new platform has business implications, like what comes easy and what comes hard. There are tradeoffs in every decision, and you need to confirm that your business team is on board.</aside>

              <li>Shared tooling</li>
              <aside class="notes">Then, let's talk about the benefits of React Native. Do you have products that would benefit from component-based UI architecture? Can you imagine sharing experiences across multiple platforms? What about your designers -- have you considered how many of their popular tools have good integrations with the React ecosystem? Perhaps even there's an opportunity to share tooling across your teams by adopting a JavaScript-powered platform. All of these are things that might push you from "maybe I'll do brownfield" to "I need to do brownfield".</aside>

            <aside class="notes">From here, it gets much more complicated. In all brownfield projects, you need to be concerned with two factors: how deep your UI integration needs to be, and how your brownfield work might depend on data. Generally, as you get deeper in both, the work becomes more reasonable. Also, having a simpler data integration is always a win, so regardless of how deep you're doing UI, less data is better.</aside>

            <aside class="notes">If you're considering using brownfield as a way to migrate features and shift platforms, you need to be concerned with the big picture for your business requirements and your product's infrastructure. We'll call these features and architecture. As you'd expect, you'll find that things are better off if both of these are in a good state. Legacy feature fit ends up being less important than architecture fit, because quite likely there will be things along the way that your product team will want to revise given the opportunity. But a crummy architecture will stifle your efforts every step along the way. And in all honestly, my product lived somewhere there on the bottom row. Those "bonus points" really pushed us over, and they might in your case too.</aside>

            <aside class="notes">And a few additional factors for brownfield migration cases. Are you able to "bite off" chunks of the application at a time? If it's a big mess, you're better off just doing greenfield. Anticipate platform challenges along the way, regardless of how much help you get. And to limit the impact of that, have a strategy in place for crashes and bugs from the beginning. If you can't negotiate on that, this approach might pose an unacceptable level of risk.</aside>

            <h2>Start small</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Begin with the simplest feature</li>
              <li>Focus on getting the tooling right</li>
            </ul>
            <aside class="notes">First, focus on delivering a low-risk UI element to production. Get your tooling in place, get the teams comfortable, and socialize the fact that you're doing a transformation. Use this as an opportunity to work through the foundations of your work, but also be sure to consider the cost-of-delay of getting things to "perfect". Find the right balance that lets you get something out without needing to get to perfect from day 1, because you will continue to revisit this point across the entire project.</aside>

            <h2>Taming the bridge</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Combine native event emitters with JS native module callback
              </li>
              <li>
                Similar approach can be used to clone states
              </li>
              <li>
                Be prepared to handle the platform lifecycle
              </li>
            </ul>
            <aside class="notes">While there are a number of exciting changes coming in this front, today we had to work within the bridge between native and react native. This meant that to share data across, we had to combine native events and javascript native modules. Through this solution, by maintaining the appropriate references on either side, you can use API definitions in either direction, or even tightly couple your application states across both environments. As soon as you pursue this though, remember that you have to handle lifecycle on both ends. This is especially important to remember on the native side, otherwise you will have users fall into odd situations that are difficult to debug.</aside>

            <h2>Transition screens</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Target the "leaf node" experiences</li>
              <li>Embed multiple React apps in the legacy nav</li>
              <li>
                Remember: if it's hard, you're probably doing something wrong
              </li>
              <li>Consider revamping your legacy nav if needed</li>
            </ul>
            <aside class="notes">Then, start figuring how you will transition screens from your legacy to the go-forward. We found the best way to do this was to take the information architecture of the app and segment screens into various experiences, then pursue those experiences from the leaves inward. Some cases may justify throwing away all of the legacy work first, but remember to stay within that defined segment so that you can continue to productionize your work along the way. If this seems hard to do, it's likely that something is wrong. Either you aren't as good of a candidate as you thought, or there's preliminary work to do within your legacy platform. We found that our navigation needed to be revamped before a transformation could be done, and you might see something like this too.</aside>

            <h2>Anticipate Platform Work</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                You own the platforms, but you have to absorb RN's changes
              </li>
              <li>
                Platform changes can impact brownfield in unexpected,
                problematic ways
              </li>
            </ul>
            <aside class="notes">Finally, remember that migrating to react native does not mean you get to ignore the native. Even if you're lucky enough to avoid changes to the legacy platform, you still own it. React Native depends on the native platforms behaving consistent with its definitions, and that was especially noticeable in 0.60. In a brownfield situation, upgrading may require significant changes across your legacy code. But falling behind on your React Native version is even more tumultuous. Anticipate that you will need to devote time every few months to addressing platform problems. This will get easier with time, and good architecture at the beginning can make this less of a factor. But if you have a number of 3rd party dependencies or deprecated code, some of the things that you must to do maintain latest React Native will take time. This is a good thing, and prepare for it.</aside>
